<h1>Real-Time Multimodal Low-light Enhancement For Edge Devices</h1>
</div>
The goal is to adapt "Wakeup-Darkness" multimodal enhancement model to achieve the best possible quality-to-speed ratio for real-time XR deployment. The objective was to optimize the computational bottlenecks (segmentation & depth) while retaining the core fusion logic and removed the grounding dino to use automatic generation of FastSAM of create full segmentation maps.
